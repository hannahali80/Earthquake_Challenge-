# Earthquake_Challenge

This project uses JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data to map major earth quakes locations. Map layers are added which can be simultaneously selcted by street, settelitte and even option for dark background.

The Maps further have options to show markers by tectonic plates and earthquakes. A legend is added at the bottom to help understand the color of marker where 0 is lowest impact of earthquake and 5+ shows higher impact.
